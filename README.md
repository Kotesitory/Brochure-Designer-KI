# Brochure Designer / KI-project

This is a finals project for User Interfaces counse on the Faculty of Information Science and Computer Engineering in Skopje.
It is a simple web application created in javascript (for the designer) and PHP (for the user authetification).
It allows users to create and save custom brochures by adding, positioning and customizing images and text-boxes. It allows users to position elements and edit their size. I used [this](https://github.com/peredurabefrog/phpSecureLogin) (thank you peredurabefrog) for the login and register functionalities, styling it with bootstrap 4. The designer uses my own stylesheet.
